# Winnipeg Transit Bus Stop Schedule

I developed this app for an assignment using the City of Winnipeg's Public Transit API to show the schedule of a selected bus stop.

To use the app, simply type in a valid street name in Winnipeg to see if there are any stop on the desired street. Next, if there are any stops on the street, then click on the stop number and you will be able to see the upcoming bus for that stop.
